The visualization interface files can be found inside the ./Project directory, which has subfolders that are explained in the VI-G03.pdf report.
The interface was tested and is fully functional in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

In order to run the interface, open a command prompt inside the ./Project folder and launch a minimal python server, what can be done using the following command:

python -m http.server

This launches a server that can be accessed in the previously mentioned browsers in the address "http://localhost:8000/", being now possible to interact with the interface.
